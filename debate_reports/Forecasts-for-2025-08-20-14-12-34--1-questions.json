There are no indications of resignation, impeachment, death, or any other events that could lead to his removal from office. Trump is actively engaged in presidential duties, issuing executive orders, and participating in official events, with multiple sources confirming his current status.\n\nThe research highlights that the 22nd Amendment allows for a non-consecutive second term, and while legal debates continue regarding his eligibility, no court actions have been taken to challenge his presidency. The potential risks to his tenure include losing the 2028 election, constitutional ineligibility, or other unforeseen events, but as of now, there are no credible threats to his position. Trump would need to win the upcoming presidential election in 2028 to remain in office by February 2029. \n\nSources used in the research include:\n1. https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SK7lotKZQ\n3. https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-makes-an-announcement-aug-6-2025/\n4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsieDdXpnlc\n5. https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nBased on current information as of August 20, 2025, **Donald Trump is serving as President of the United States**, having begun his second (non-consecutive) term in January 2025[1](https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart)[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SK7lotKZQ)[3](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-makes-an-announcement-aug-6-2025/)[5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/). There is no public indication of resignation, impeachment, death, or other events that would remove him from office at this time[1](https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart)[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SK7lotKZQ)[3](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-makes-an-announcement-aug-6-2025/)[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsieDdXpnlc)[5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/).\n\nKey context and supporting details:\n\n- **Trump's Current Status:** Multiple official sources and news reports confirm Trump is actively performing presidential duties, issuing executive orders, and participating in White House events as of August 2025[1](https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart)[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SK7lotKZQ)[3](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-makes-an-announcement-aug-6-2025/)[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsieDdXpnlc)[5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/).\n- **Constitutional Eligibility:** The 22nd Amendment states, \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\" Trump won in 2016, lost in 2020, and won again in 2024. Legal scholars continue to debate whether a non-consecutive second term is constitutionally permissible, but Trump was allowed to run and was inaugurated in January 2025. No court has blocked his presidency or indicated imminent legal action that would remove him[1](https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart)[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SK7lotKZQ)[3](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-makes-an-announcement-aug-6-2025/)[5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/).\n- **Risks to Tenure:** The question will resolve \"No\" if Trump is not President in February 2029 for any reason, including losing the 2028 election, constitutional ineligibility, resignation, death, or impeachment and removal. As of now, there are no credible reports of health issues, impeachment proceedings, or other threats to his tenure[1](https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart)[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SK7lotKZQ)[3](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-makes-an-announcement-aug-6-2025/)[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsieDdXpnlc)[5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/).\n- **Upcoming Election:** Trump would need to win the 2028 presidential election to remain President in February 2029. The constitutional debate over a third term (second non-consecutive) may intensify as the 2028 election approaches, but no legal barrier has yet been enforced[1](https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart)[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SK7lotKZQ)[3](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-makes-an-announcement-aug-6-2025/)[5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/).\n\nIf the question were resolved today, it would resolve **Yes**, as Trump is currently serving as President. Future developments\u2014especially legal challenges or election outcomes\u2014could change this status, but no such events have occurred as of August 2025[1](https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart)[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SK7lotKZQ)[3](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-makes-an-announcement-aug-6-2025/)[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsieDdXpnlc)[5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/).\n\n# FORECASTS\n\n## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning\nDebater 1 reasoning:\nTo forecast whether Donald Trump will be President in February 2029, we need to consider several factors, including the time until the outcome is known, the current status quo, and potential scenarios that could lead to either a \"Yes\" or \"No\" outcome.\n\n(a) **The time left until the outcome is known:**\n- We are currently in August 2025, and the question will be resolved in February 2029. This gives us approximately 3.5 years until the outcome is known. During this time, several key events will occur, including the 2028 presidential election, which will be crucial in determining whether Trump remains President in 2029.\n\n(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**\n- As of now, Donald Trump is serving as President, having been inaugurated for his second non-consecutive term in January 2025. If the status quo remains unchanged, he would not be President in February 2029, as his current term would end in January 2029. Therefore, for him to be President in February 2029, he would need to win the 2028 election.\n\n(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**\n- Trump could lose the 2028 presidential election, either in the primaries or the general election. Additionally, legal challenges regarding his eligibility to run for a third term could arise, potentially preventing him from running or serving if elected. Other factors such as health issues, impeachment, or resignation could also lead to a \"No\" outcome.\n\n(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**\n- Trump successfully runs for and wins the 2028 presidential election, overcoming any legal challenges regarding his eligibility. This would require maintaining strong political support and addressing any constitutional debates that might arise. If he wins the election, he would be inaugurated for another term in January 2029, making him President in February 2029.\n\n(e) **Key evidence and how it pushes towards or away from each resolution:**\n- **Towards Yes:** Trump is currently serving as President, indicating that legal challenges to his eligibility have not been successful thus far. His ability to win the 2024 election suggests he has significant political support, which could carry into the 2028 election.\n- **Towards No:** The constitutional debate over a third term could intensify, potentially leading to legal challenges that prevent him from running or serving. Additionally, the political landscape could change, with new candidates emerging and shifting public opinion.\n\nGiven the current status and potential scenarios, the probability of Trump being President in February 2029 depends heavily on the outcome of the 2028 election and any legal challenges that may arise. While the status quo suggests he is currently President, the uncertainty surrounding future elections and legal interpretations of the 22nd Amendment introduces significant risk.\n\n**Probability: 40%**\n\nDebater 2 reasoning:\n(a) **The time left until the outcome is known:**  \nThe outcome will be known by February 2029, which is approximately 3.5 years from the current date of August 2025. This time frame includes the 2028 presidential election, which is a critical event for determining whether Trump will continue as President into 2029.\n\n(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nAs of now, Donald Trump is serving as President, having been inaugurated for his second non-consecutive term in January 2025. If the status quo remains unchanged, he would continue to serve until January 2029. However, to be President in February 2029, he would need to win the 2028 election. The status quo suggests that he is currently eligible to run and serve, as no legal challenges have successfully barred him from office.\n\n(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**  \nA \"No\" outcome could occur if Trump loses the 2028 presidential election. Additionally, legal challenges regarding his eligibility to run for a third term (second non-consecutive) could intensify, potentially leading to a court ruling that bars him from running. Other scenarios include impeachment and removal from office, resignation, or health issues that prevent him from serving.\n\n(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  \nA \"Yes\" outcome would occur if Trump wins the 2028 presidential election and continues to serve as President into February 2029. This scenario assumes that no legal barriers prevent him from running and that he maintains sufficient political support to secure another term.\n\n(e) **Key evidence and how it pushes towards or away from each resolution:**  \n- **Towards Yes:** Trump is currently serving as President, indicating that, as of now, there are no legal barriers preventing him from holding office. His ability to run and win in 2024 suggests he could potentially do so again in 2028. The lack of current impeachment proceedings or health issues also supports a \"Yes\" outcome.\n- **Towards No:** The constitutional debate over the 22nd Amendment could lead to legal challenges that prevent him from running in 2028. Additionally, the political landscape could change, affecting his chances of winning the election. The possibility of unforeseen events, such as health issues or political scandals, could also lead to a \"No\" outcome.\n\nGiven the current status and the potential for change over the next 3.5 years, the probability of Trump being President in February 2029 is influenced by both his current position and the uncertainties surrounding future legal and electoral challenges.\n\n**Probability: 55%**\n\nConsensus reached immediately.\n\n",
