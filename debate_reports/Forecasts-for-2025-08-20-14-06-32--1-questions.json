The analysis suggests that if the question were to be resolved today, the answer would be affirmative, as Trump is currently in office and would remain so through February 2029 unless he were to be removed, resign, die, or be found constitutionally ineligible. \n\nKey considerations include the ongoing debate surrounding the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidential terms, and whether it affects Trump's eligibility for future elections. The outcome of the 2028 presidential election is critical; if Trump runs and wins, he would continue as President into February 2029. Currently, there are no indications of disqualification or removal from office, although health, legal, and political risks could potentially impact his presidency. The main uncertainties revolve around the 2028 election, constitutional challenges, and unforeseen events that could affect his ability to serve.\n\nSources used:\n- https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/\n- https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart\n- https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbuhxmt3DwE\n- https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-makes-an-announcement-aug-6-2025/\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nBased on current information, Donald Trump is serving as President as of August 2025, having won the 2024 election and begun his second (non-consecutive) term in January 2025[2](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/)[1](https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart)[5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/). If the question were to resolve today, the answer would be Yes\u2014Trump is President and would remain so into February 2029 unless removed, resigning, dying, or being found constitutionally ineligible before then.\n\nKey context and relevant developments:\n\n- **Trump\u2019s Status:** Trump is actively serving as President, issuing executive orders and making public appearances as of August 2025[1](https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart)[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbuhxmt3DwE)[4](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-makes-an-announcement-aug-6-2025/)[5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/).\n- **Term Limits and Constitutional Debate:** The 22nd Amendment states that \"no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\" There is ongoing legal and academic debate about whether this bars someone from serving two non-consecutive terms (as Trump is now doing) or from seeking a third term in total. However, Trump\u2019s current (second) term is within the two-term limit, so this debate would only become directly relevant if he sought a third term in 2028.\n- **2028 Election:** The outcome of the 2028 presidential election will be decisive. If Trump runs and wins, and is not barred by the Constitution or other means, he would be President in February 2029. If he loses, is removed, resigns, dies, or is otherwise unable to serve, the answer would resolve No.\n- **No Current Disqualification:** As of August 2025, there is no indication from official sources or news that Trump has been disqualified, impeached, or otherwise removed from office[1](https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart)[2](https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/donald-j-trump/)[5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/).\n- **Health, Legal, and Political Risks:** As with any sitting President, there are ongoing risks (health, impeachment, resignation, etc.) that could affect his ability to serve through February 2029, but no such events have occurred or are imminent as of now.\n\nIf the question were resolved today, it would resolve Yes, as Trump is President. The main future uncertainties are the 2028 election outcome, potential constitutional challenges, and unforeseen events affecting his presidency.\n\n# FORECASTS\n\n## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning\nDebater 1 reasoning:\nTo forecast whether Donald Trump will be President in February 2029, we need to consider several factors, including the time until the outcome is known, the current status quo, and potential scenarios that could lead to either a Yes or No resolution.\n\n(a) **The time left until the outcome is known:**\n- We are currently in August 2025, and the question will resolve in February 2029. This gives us approximately 3.5 years until the outcome is known. During this time, several key events will occur, including the 2028 presidential election, which will be a significant determinant of the outcome.\n\n(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**\n- As of now, Donald Trump is serving as President, having won the 2024 election. If nothing changes, he will continue to serve until January 2029, which means he would still be President in February 2029. The status quo outcome, therefore, is a Yes resolution.\n\n(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**\n- Several scenarios could lead to a No outcome:\n1. **2028 Election Loss:** Trump could lose the 2028 presidential election, either in the primaries or the general election.\n2. **Constitutional Challenge:** A successful legal challenge could determine that Trump is ineligible to run for a third term due to the 22nd Amendment.\n3. **Health or Personal Issues:** Trump could face health issues or personal decisions that lead to resignation or inability to serve.\n4. **Impeachment or Removal:** Trump could be impeached and removed from office before February 2029.\n\n(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**\n- For a Yes outcome, Trump would need to:\n1. **Win the 2028 Election:** Trump would need to run and win the 2028 election, assuming no constitutional barriers prevent him from doing so.\n2. **Maintain Health and Political Stability:** Trump would need to avoid significant health issues or political crises that could lead to resignation or removal.\n\n(e) **Key evidence and how it pushes towards or away from each resolution:**\n- **Towards Yes:**\n- Trump is currently serving as President, indicating political viability and support.\n- There is no current legal disqualification preventing him from serving.\n- The status quo favors continuity, and incumbents often have advantages in elections.\n- **Towards No:**\n- The 2028 election presents a significant uncertainty, with potential challengers and changing political dynamics.\n- The constitutional debate over the 22nd Amendment could lead to legal challenges.\n- Health and age-related concerns could impact Trump's ability to serve.\n\nGiven the current status quo and the potential for change over the next 3.5 years, the probability of Trump being President in February 2029 is influenced by both the stability of his current term and the uncertainties of future events. While the status quo suggests a Yes outcome, the significant uncertainties, particularly regarding the 2028 election and constitutional challenges, must be considered.\n\n**Probability: 60%**\n\nDebater 2 reasoning:\n(a) **The time left until the outcome is known:**\nThere are approximately 3.5 years until February 2029. This period includes the remainder of Trump's current term, the 2028 presidential election, and the subsequent inauguration in January 2029. This time frame allows for various developments, including political, legal, and health-related events that could impact Trump's presidency.\n\n(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**\nIf the current situation remains unchanged, Trump will continue to serve as President until January 2029. Given that he is currently in office and there are no immediate threats to his presidency, the status quo suggests a Yes outcome for February 2029, assuming he wins the 2028 election and no constitutional barriers prevent him from serving.\n\n(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**\nA No outcome could occur if Trump loses the 2028 election, is found constitutionally ineligible to run or serve, or if unforeseen events such as impeachment, resignation, or health issues prevent him from completing his term. Additionally, legal challenges regarding the interpretation of the 22nd Amendment could arise, potentially barring him from seeking a third term.\n\n(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**\nA Yes outcome would occur if Trump successfully runs for and wins the 2028 election, and no constitutional challenges prevent him from serving a third term. This scenario assumes that he remains politically viable, maintains his health, and faces no significant legal or political obstacles.\n\n(e) **Key evidence and how it pushes towards or away from each resolution:**\n- **Towards Yes:** Trump is currently serving as President, indicating political viability and support. There are no immediate legal or constitutional challenges preventing him from serving his current term. The status quo favors continuity, and Trump's ability to win the 2024 election suggests he could be a strong contender in 2028.\n- **Towards No:** The 22nd Amendment debate could become a significant barrier if legal challenges arise. Additionally, the unpredictability of political dynamics, potential health issues, or other unforeseen events could prevent Trump from serving in February 2029. The outcome of the 2028 election is a major uncertainty, as it will determine whether he can continue as President.\n\nConsidering the current status and potential scenarios, the probability of Trump being President in February 2029 is influenced by the status quo but tempered by the uncertainties of future events, particularly the 2028 election and constitutional debates.\n\n**Probability: 60%**\n\nConsensus reached immediately.\n\n",
