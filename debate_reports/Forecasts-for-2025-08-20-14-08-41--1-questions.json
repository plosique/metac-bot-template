He is actively engaged in presidential duties, including issuing executive orders and making public appearances, with no credible reports suggesting that he has left office or is unable to serve. The research highlights ongoing debates regarding the 22nd Amendment, which restricts individuals from being elected to the presidency more than twice. While there are discussions among legal scholars about whether this amendment would prevent Trump from serving a third term, no definitive judicial or legislative actions have been taken to clarify his eligibility for a potential third term starting in 2029.\n\nThe research notes that the question of whether Trump will be President in February 2029 will be resolved affirmatively if he remains in office, and negatively if he does not due to any circumstances such as constitutional ineligibility, election loss, resignation, or removal. Currently, there are no reported legal or political obstacles that would hinder his ability to serve through the end of his current term in January 2029, and there have been no announcements or developments regarding a potential third term or the 22nd Amendment issue.\n\nSources used:\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Donald_Trump's_second_presidency_(2025_Q1)\n2. https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart\n3. https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/\n4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbuhxmt3DwE\n5. https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-gaggles-with-the-press-on-air-force-one-aug-15-2025/\n\n\n# RESEARCH\n## Report 1 Research\nBased on current information as of August 20, 2025, **Donald Trump is serving as President of the United States**, having begun his second (non-consecutive) term in January 2025 after winning the 2024 election[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Donald_Trump's_second_presidency_(2025_Q1))[2](https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart)[4](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/). There is no credible news or official action indicating that he has left office, been removed, or is otherwise unable to serve as President at this time[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbuhxmt3DwE)[4](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/)[5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-gaggles-with-the-press-on-air-force-one-aug-15-2025/).\n\n**Key context and supporting details:**\n\n- **Trump\u2019s Status:** Trump is actively performing presidential duties, issuing executive orders, making public appearances, and engaging in policy initiatives as of mid-August 2025[2](https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart)[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbuhxmt3DwE)[4](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/)[5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-gaggles-with-the-press-on-air-force-one-aug-15-2025/).\n- **22nd Amendment Debate:** The constitutional question of whether Trump could serve a third term (i.e., be President in 2029) hinges on the interpretation of the 22nd Amendment, which states that \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\" Legal scholars have debated whether this bars a non-consecutive third term, but as of now, there is no judicial or legislative action clarifying or enforcing a prohibition specific to Trump\u2019s eligibility for a third term starting in 2029. No major news outlet or government body has reported a definitive resolution to this debate.\n- **Question Resolution Criteria:** The question will resolve Yes if Trump is President in February 2029, and No if he is not, for any reason (including constitutional ineligibility, election loss, resignation, death, or removal).\n\n**If the question were to resolve today, the answer would be No,** since it is August 2025 and the question asks about February 2029. However, based on current news, **Trump is eligible and actively serving as President, with no immediate legal or political obstacles reported that would prevent him from remaining in office through the end of his current term (January 2029)**[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Donald_Trump's_second_presidency_(2025_Q1))[2](https://www.hklaw.com/en/general-pages/trumps-2025-executive-orders-chart)[4](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/)[5](https://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/president-trump-gaggles-with-the-press-on-air-force-one-aug-15-2025/). \n\nThere is no current news indicating that Trump has announced intentions or legal actions regarding a potential third term, nor any developments that would clarify the 22nd Amendment issue as it pertains to February 2029.\n\n# FORECASTS\n\n## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning\nDebater 1 reasoning:\nTo forecast whether Donald Trump will be President in February 2029, we need to consider several factors, including the time until the outcome is known, the current status quo, and potential scenarios that could lead to either a Yes or No resolution.\n\n(a) **The time left until the outcome is known:**\n- We have approximately 3.5 years until February 2029. This is a significant amount of time in which political, legal, and personal developments could occur that might impact Trump's presidency.\n\n(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**\n- As of August 2025, Donald Trump is serving as President, having won the 2024 election. If the status quo remains unchanged, he will complete his current term, which ends in January 2029. However, the question pertains to February 2029, which would require him to win the 2028 election and be inaugurated for a third term. The status quo does not currently support this outcome due to the 22nd Amendment debate.\n\n(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**\n- Trump could lose the 2028 election, either in the primaries or the general election.\n- Legal challenges or a definitive judicial ruling could interpret the 22nd Amendment as barring him from serving a third term.\n- Health issues, resignation, or other personal factors could prevent him from running or serving.\n- Political dynamics could shift, leading to a stronger opposition candidate or a change in public sentiment.\n\n(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**\n- Trump could run for and win the 2028 election, assuming no legal barriers prevent him from doing so.\n- The constitutional debate over the 22nd Amendment could resolve in his favor, either through judicial interpretation or lack of legal challenge.\n- He could maintain or increase his political influence and popularity, securing the Republican nomination and winning the general election.\n\n(e) **Key evidence and how it pushes towards or away from each resolution:**\n- **Towards No:** The 22nd Amendment presents a significant legal hurdle, and there is no current resolution to this debate. Additionally, the political landscape can change dramatically over 3.5 years, and Trump's age and health could become factors.\n- **Towards Yes:** Trump has demonstrated resilience and a strong base of support, having won the 2024 election. If he maintains his political influence and the legal interpretation of the 22nd Amendment remains unresolved or in his favor, he could potentially run again.\n\nGiven the current information and the significant legal and political uncertainties, the probability of Trump being President in February 2029 is relatively low. The status quo does not support a third term without changes in legal interpretation or political dynamics.\n\n**Probability: 20%**\n\nDebater 2 reasoning:\n(a) **The time left until the outcome is known:**  \nWe have approximately 3.5 years until February 2029. This is a significant amount of time in which various political, legal, and personal developments could occur that might impact Donald Trump's ability to serve as President in 2029.\n\n(b) **The status quo outcome if nothing changed:**  \nIf the status quo remains unchanged, Donald Trump will complete his current term, which ends in January 2029. However, the status quo does not guarantee that he will be President in February 2029, as he would need to be re-elected in the 2028 election or otherwise assume the presidency through succession.\n\n(c) **A scenario that results in a No outcome:**  \n1. **Constitutional Ineligibility:** A legal or judicial decision could clarify that the 22nd Amendment prohibits Trump from serving a third term, effectively barring him from running in 2028.\n2. **Election Loss:** Trump could run in the 2028 election but lose to another candidate, either in the primaries or the general election.\n3. **Health or Personal Issues:** Trump could face health issues or personal decisions that lead him to not seek or be unable to serve another term.\n4. **Impeachment or Removal:** Trump could be impeached and removed from office before the end of his current term, affecting his ability to run again.\n\n(d) **A scenario that results in a Yes outcome:**  \n1. **Re-election in 2028:** Trump could run for and win the 2028 presidential election, assuming the presidency again in January 2029.\n2. **Succession:** If Trump does not run or loses the 2028 election, he could still become President if the elected President is unable to serve and Trump is in the line of succession (e.g., as Vice President).\n\n(e) **Key evidence and how it pushes towards or away from each resolution:**  \n- **22nd Amendment Debate:** The lack of a definitive legal resolution regarding the 22nd Amendment's applicability to non-consecutive terms leaves open the possibility of Trump running again. This uncertainty slightly favors a Yes outcome, as it does not currently prevent him from seeking another term.\n- **Current Political Climate:** Trump's active role as President and his demonstrated ability to win elections suggest he could be a strong candidate in 2028, pushing towards a Yes outcome.\n- **Health and Age Considerations:** Trump will be in his early 80s by 2029, which could impact his decision or ability to run, slightly favoring a No outcome.\n- **Political Opposition and Dynamics:** The political landscape could shift significantly by 2028, with potential strong challengers emerging, which could lead to a No outcome.\n\nGiven the current information and the weight of the status quo, the probability of Trump being President in February 2029 is moderate but uncertain due to the unresolved constitutional question and the time remaining for various developments.\n\n**Probability: 35%**\n\nConsensus reached immediately.\n\n",
